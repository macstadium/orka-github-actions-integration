# Orka GitHub runner

[Orka](https://www.macstadium.com/orka) GitHub runner is a tool that integrates with GitHub to provide demand-based solution for customer workflows.
It leverages ephemeral runners to ensure real-time execution and dynamic scaling, eliminating the need for manual provisioning and maintenance of runners.

## Features

* **Real-time execution:** Ephemeral runners are spun up on demand, ensuring that customer workflows are executed instantly without delays.

* **Dynamic scaling:** Orka GitHub runner automatically scales the number of runners based on the demand for customer workflows, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

* **Secure integration:** Orka GitHub runner utilizes a dedicated GitHub app for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to customer GitHub resources.

The Orka Runner application utilizes Runner scale sets in a manner similar to the [ARC project](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller). Runner scale sets is a group of homogeneous runners that can be assigned jobs from GitHub Actions. More information about runner scale sets can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller).

## Prerequisites

Before using the Orka GitHub Runner, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* GitHub App: Having a GitHub App is a prerequisite for using the Orka GitHub Runner. You can find instructions on creating a GitHub App in the [Creating a GitHub app](docs/github-app-setup-steps.md) file.
* Connectivity to Orka 3.0+ cluster: Ensure that the machine where the Orka Github Runner is started has connectivity to an Orka cluster.

## Setting up the Orka GitHub runner

### Environment variables

The Orka GitHub runner requires the following environment variabales to be configured:
* `GITHUB_APP_ID`: The unique identifier for the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`: The installation identifier for the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` or `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key associated with the GitHub App. You can either provide the file path to the private key using `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` or directly provide the private key string using `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. At least one of these environment variables must be set.
* `GITHUB_URL`: The URL of the GitHub repository or organization.
* `ORKA_URL`: The URL of the Orka server.
* `ORKA_TOKEN`: The authentication token for accessing the Orka API.
* `ORKA_VM_CONFIG`: The name of the VM config that will be used when deploying Orka virtual machines.
* `ORKA_VM_USERNAME`: Specifies the username for the deployed VMs. If no value is provided, it defaults to admin.
* `ORKA_VM_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password for the deployed VMs. If no value is provided, it defaults to admin.
* `RUNNERS`: A JSON array containing configuration details of the runners.
* `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level for the Orka GitHub Runner (e.g., debug, info, error).

To start the Orka GitHub runner using Docker, you have two options:

1. Provide all of the environment variables directly in the docker run command

```shell
docker run -e GITHUB_APP_ID=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_URL=<value> \
    -e ORKA_URL=<value> \
    -e ORKA_TOKEN=<value> \
    -e ORKA_VM_CONFIG=<value> \
    -e RUNNERS=<value> \
    ghcr.io/macstadium/orka-github-actions-integration/orka-github-runner:<tag-name>
```

2. Provide a .env file containing all the environment variables and mount it as a volume when running the Docker container:

```shell
docker run -v /path/to/.env:/.env ghcr.io/macstadium/orka-github-actions-integration/orka-github-runner:<tag-name>
```

Replace <tag-name> with the version or tag of the Orka GitHub runner you want to use.
