# Orka GitHub runner

[Orka](https://www.macstadium.com/orka) GitHub runner is a tool that integrates with GitHub to provide demand-based solution for customer workflows.
It leverages ephemeral runners to ensure real-time execution and dynamic scaling, eliminating the need for manual provisioning and maintenance of runners.

> **NOTE**: This project is not affiliated with the original [Actions Runner Controller (ARC)](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) project but uses portions of its code under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

## Features

* **Real-time execution:** Ephemeral runners are spun up on demand, ensuring that customer workflows are executed instantly without delays.

* **Dynamic scaling:** Orka GitHub runner automatically scales the number of runners based on the demand for customer workflows, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

* **Secure integration:** Orka GitHub runner utilizes a dedicated GitHub app for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to customer GitHub resources.

The Orka Runner application utilizes Runner scale sets in a manner similar to the [ARC project](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller). Runner scale sets is a group of homogeneous runners that can be assigned jobs from GitHub Actions. More information about runner scale sets can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller).

## Prerequisites

Before using the Orka GitHub Runner, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* GitHub App: Having a GitHub App is a prerequisite for using the Orka GitHub Runner. You can find instructions on creating a GitHub App in the [Creating a GitHub app](docs/github-app-setup-steps.md) file.
* Connectivity to Orka 3.0+ cluster: Ensure that the machine where the Orka Github Runner is started has connectivity to the Orka cluster. Additionally, ensure that the SSH ports are open to enable the runner to establish SSH connections with Orka VMs.
* The Orka GitHub runner supports GitHub.com hosted environments.

> **NOTE**: Currently, GitHub Enterprise Server is not supported.

## Setting up the Orka GitHub runner

You can get the Orka GitHub runner by downloading it from [this link](https://github.com/macstadium/orka-github-actions-integration/pkgs/container/orka-github-runner). You will be able to execute the runner (via `docker run`) from any machine that has connectivity to the Orka cluster. If running within MacStadium, you can request 2 vCPU of Private Cloud x86 compute to run the container.

### Environment variables

The Orka GitHub runner requires the following environment variabales to be configured:
* `GITHUB_APP_ID`: The unique identifier for the GitHub App. Detailed instructions on setting up a GitHub app can be found [here](./docs/github-app-setup-steps.md).
* `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`: The installation identifier for the GitHub App.
* `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` or `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key associated with the GitHub App. You can either provide the file path to the private key using `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` or directly provide the private key string using `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. At least one of these environment variables must be set.
* `GITHUB_URL`: The URL of the GitHub repository or organization.
* `ORKA_URL`: The URL of the Orka server.
* `ORKA_TOKEN`: The authentication token for accessing the Orka API. A token can be generated by an admin user with the command `orka3 sa token <service-account-name>`.
* `ORKA_VM_CONFIG`: The name of the VM config that will be used when deploying Orka virtual machines. A config can be created with the command `orka3 vmc create --image <image-name>`.
* `ORKA_VM_USERNAME`: Specifies the username for the deployed VMs. If no value is provided, it defaults to admin.
* `ORKA_VM_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password for the deployed VMs. If no value is provided, it defaults to admin.
* `ORKA_VM_METADATA`: Specifies custom VM metadata passed to the VM. Must be formatted as key=value comma separated pairs.
* `ORKA_ENABLE_NODE_IP_MAPPING`: Specifies whether to enable the mapping of Orka node IPs to external IPs.
* `ORKA_NODE_IP_MAPPING`: Defines the mapping of Orka node internal IPs to external host IPs.
* `RUNNERS`: A JSON array containing configuration details of the GitHub runner scale set that will be created. Currently only one runner is supported. See [here](#how-to-use-multiple-runners) for how to use multiple runners. Example usage: `RUNNERS='[{"name":"my-github-runner"}]'`. The `name` field should match the value specified in the `runs-on` field in the Actions workflow. See an example [here](./examples/ci.yml).
* `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level for the Orka GitHub Runner (e.g., debug, info, error). If not provided, it defaults to info.

For a complete example of the required format, refer to the `.env` file located in the examples directory [here](./examples/.env).

To start the Orka GitHub runner using Docker, you have two options:

1. Provide all of the environment variables directly in the docker run command

```shell
docker run -e GITHUB_APP_ID=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=<value> \
    -e GITHUB_URL=<value> \
    -e ORKA_URL=<value> \
    -e ORKA_TOKEN=<value> \
    -e ORKA_VM_CONFIG=<value> \
    -e RUNNERS=<value> \
    ghcr.io/macstadium/orka-github-runner:<tag-name>
```

2. Provide a .env file containing all the environment variables and mount it as a volume when running the Docker container:

```shell
docker run -v /path/to/.env:/.env ghcr.io/macstadium/orka-github-runner:<tag-name>
```

Replace <tag-name> with the version or tag of the Orka GitHub runner you want to use.

> **NOTE**: The private key must be in PKCS#1 RSA private key format. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps#generating-private-keys) for more information. If needed, convert the private key to the correct format: `ssh-keygen -p -m pem -f /path/to/private-key.pem`

#### How to use multiple runners

Currently, our setup supports only one runner scale set. However, if you need to have multiple runner scale sets, you can achieve this by running multiple instances of the Orka GitHub runner and providing the runner configuration for each of them. Each instance would have its own unique runner name specified in the RUNNERS environment variable.
