# Build testing and automation

## Internal tooling for integration testing

We use robust internal tooling to automate nightly builds, ensuring all changes made to the Orka GitHub Actions integration are tested consistently.

### Quality Assurance

The system scans for recent changes nightly, triggers build pipelines, and runs a suite of integration tests. This helps to maintain the stability and reliability of the integration over time.

### Benefits

- Early detection of issues
- Reduces manual testing effort
- Increases preparedness for new releases of the application
